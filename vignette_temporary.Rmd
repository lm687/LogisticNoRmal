This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) vignette for the package LogisticNoRmal.


```{r}
library(LogisticNoRmal)
library(MCMCpack)
library(compositions)
library(MASS)
```


We simulate data that lie on the simplex:
```{r}
X = MCMCpack::rdirichlet(1000, c(0.3, 0.5, 3))
```

```{r}
plot(acomp(X))
```

Fit a logistic normal distribution. The inferred parameters are n mean values (for each of the $n$ parts of the composition) and an $n\times n$ covariance matrix.

```{r}
fit_LN = fit_logistic_normal(x = X)
fit_LN
```


To sample from the distribution (with parameters as inferred), we can use `fit_LN`.

```{r}
intances_LN = 
plot(acomp(X_instances))

```
