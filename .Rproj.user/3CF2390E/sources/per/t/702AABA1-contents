This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(LogisticNoRmal, lib.loc = "~/Documents/PhD/other_repos")
library(compositions)
```


We simulate data that lie on the simplex:
```{r}
X = MCMCpack::rdirichlet(1000, c(0.3, 0.5, 3))
```

```{r}
plot(acomp(X))
```

```{r}
sum(inverse_alr_vec(c(2, 4, 1)))
inverse_alr_mat

rowSums(inverse_alr_mat(as(compositions::alr(MCMCpack::rdirichlet(1000, rep(1, 5))), 'matrix')))

alr_mat(MCMCpack::rdirichlet(1000, rep(1, 5)))

```
Fit

```{r}
b = fit_logistic_normal(x = X)
# 
#   alr_x = alr_mat(X)
#   mu = colMeans(alr_x)
#   covar = cov(alr_x)
#   return(list(mu=mu, covariance=covar))

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
